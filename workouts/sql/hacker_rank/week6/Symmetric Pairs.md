Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

```SQL
SELECT X, Y
FROM FUNCTIONS
WHERE X = Y
GROUP BY X, Y
HAVING COUNT(*) = 2

UNION

SELECT F1.X, F1.Y
FROM FUNCTIONS F1
    INNER JOIN FUNCTIONS F2 ON F1.X = F2.Y AND F1.Y = F2.X
WHERE F1.X < F1.Y
ORDER BY X
